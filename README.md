# TP (Discord.js Bot)

This bot is a simple bot made with Discord.js (with the help of some node packages).

# Install
First, download the Github repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DET171/TP.git
```
Alternatively, you can just download the zip file from Github, and then unzip it.
After that, install the node packages needed:
```bash
npm i 
```
# Usage
After installing all the packages, you still need to add the bot token. Create a `.env` file (name it exactly `.env`, not `stuff.env` or things like that, and add the following inside:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=token
```
Replace 'token' with your own Discord bot token (duh). Do not add spaces or quotes.

Finally, start your bot:
```bash
node index.js
```
